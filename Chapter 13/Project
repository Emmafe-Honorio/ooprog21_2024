Create a class named BloodData that includes String fields that hold a blood type (the four blood types are O, A, B, and AB) and an Rh factor (the factorsire + and -). Create a default constructor that ets the fieldsds foand + and an overloaded constructor that requires values for both fields. Include gel and set methods for each field. Save this file as BloodData.java.
b. Create an application named TestBloodData that declares two objects. Prompt the user for values for one, and use the default constructor values for the other. Display the details of both objects. Then change the values in the default object so it uses the user's values, and display the details for the object again to confirm the changes are made correctly. Save the application as TestBloodData.java.
c. Create a class named Patient that includes an ID number, age, and BloodData. Provide a default constructor that sets the ID number to 0, the age to 0, and the BloodData values to the default BloodData values (O and +). Create an overloaded constructor that provides values for each field. Also provide get methods for each field. Save the file as Patient.java.
d. Create an application that declares three Patient objects. Use all default values for one Patient object, prompt the user for values for the second Patient object, and for the third object, prompt the user for Patient data but use default values for that Patient's BloodData. Save the file as TestPatient.java.
